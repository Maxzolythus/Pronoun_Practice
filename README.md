<h1>Pronoun Practice</h1>

ABSTRACT
---------------

Misgendering happens to many trans people every day, and the most frequent excuses I hear is that these pronouns just aren't used
as much, conjugation is hard, and it's just too hard to use them. Well that's were this app comes in handy, instead of having to only 
practice on your friends, family, coworkers, etc. Now you can practice in an eviroment without the akward moment of misgendering a person.
